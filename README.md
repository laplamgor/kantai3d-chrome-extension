Kantai3D is not an officially approved program. Using it may be against the Terms of Service of DMM.

Kantai3D modifies your local game client (main.js) in order to achieve the visual effects but does not modify any in-game API request and response. It does not affect your normal gameplay or game balance. 

Please use it at your own risk. 


This mod alone does not include any data from the origin game. All depth maps used are also 100% hand-drawn.
